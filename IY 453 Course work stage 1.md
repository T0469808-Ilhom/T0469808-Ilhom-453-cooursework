## Introduction:



The aim of this program is to create an interactive text-based “choose your own adventure” game in C++ that delivers a structured story with branching paths based on the player’s choices. The player progresses through scenes by selecting between two options, with consequences that may lead to success, new routes, item collection, or game over. To enhance gameplay and replayability, the program includes player name personalisation, inventory management with meaningful item effects, puzzle and combat encounters, a scoring system, and save/load features, while applying strong input validation to prevent crashes and handle invalid inputs reliably.
